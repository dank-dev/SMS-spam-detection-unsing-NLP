# SMS-spam-detection-using-NLP
This is the notebook that we have used for SMS spam message detection using data set from SMS spam collection data from UCI.
The file we are using contains a collection of more than 5 thousand SMS phone messages.
We have two type of SMS one is spam and other is ham (ie: not a fake message).
After doing training and testing ,we got 96% accuracy of finding which SMS is spam and ham.
